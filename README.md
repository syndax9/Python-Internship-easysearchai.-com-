# Project Overview
## 1. Introduction
  This project aims to predict California housing prices using features like median income, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, and ocean  proximity.   It involves data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training with different algorithms.

## 2. Data Loading
  Load and inspect the dataset to understand its shape, structure, and basic statistics. Check data types, identify missing values, and compute initial metrics for     numerical features.

## 3. Data Cleaning
  Handle missing values, particularly in 'total_bedrooms', by removing rows with these values to ensure a clean dataset.

## 4. Data Splitting
  Separate features (X) from the target variable ('median_house_value', y) and split the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio.

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Visualize feature distributions and relationships using histograms and heatmaps to understand feature correlations with the target variable.

## 6. Data Transformation
  Normalize feature distributions with logarithmic transformations on features like 'total_rooms' and 'total_bedrooms'. Apply one-hot encoding to categorical       
  features like 'ocean_proximity' and create new features like 'bedroom_ratio' and 'household_rooms'.

## 7. Model Training and Evaluation
  Linear Regression: Standardize features, train the model, and evaluate performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 Score, with visualizations   
                     comparing actual vs. predicted values.
  Random Forest Regressor: Standardize features, train the model, and compare performance metrics with Linear Regression.
## 8. Model Comparison
  Compare both models based on train and test accuracy, MSE, and R2 Score using scatter plots and bar graphs to evaluate effectiveness.

The process of model training and evaluation involves selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms, training them on the dataset, and assessing their performance using various metrics. This project utilizes two models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor. Here's a detailed explanation of the steps involved:

## 1. Linear Regression Model
Feature Scaling:
  Before training, the features are standardized using StandardScaler. This involves rescaling the features so that they have a mean of zero and a standard 
  deviation of one. Standardization is crucial for algorithms like Linear Regression, which are sensitive to the scale of the data.
Model Training:
  The Linear Regression model is trained on the scaled training data (X_train_s). The model learns the relationships between the features and the target variable   
  (median_house_value) by minimizing the residual sum of squares between the observed targets and the predicted targets.
Predictions and Evaluation:
  The trained model is used to make predictions on the scaled test data (X_test_s). The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squares of the errors, providing a sense of how far off predictions are from actual values.
R2 Score: 
  Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. A higher R2 score signifies a 
  better fit.
Visualization:
  The actual vs. predicted values are visualized using scatter plots, allowing for a visual assessment of the model's performance. A diagonal line representing   
  perfect prediction is included for reference.
## 2. Random Forest Regressor
Model Training:
  The Random Forest Regressor is trained on the same standardized features. This ensemble learning method combines multiple decision trees, each trained on a 
  random subset of the data, to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting.
Predictions and Evaluation:
  The model's predictions on the test set are evaluated similarly to the Linear Regression model. The same metrics (MSE and R2 Score) are used to assess its 
  performance.
Visualization:
  Like the Linear Regression model, the actual vs. predicted values are plotted to visualize the model's accuracy.
## 3. Model Comparison
  The performance of the Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models is compared using their evaluation metrics. This comparison helps determine which 
  model is more accurate and reliable for predicting housing prices.
Evaluation Metrics:
Train Accuracy: The accuracy of the model on the training dataset.
Test Accuracy: The accuracy of the model on the testing dataset.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Lower values indicate better accuracy.
R2 Score: A higher score closer to 1 indicates a better fit.

The Random Forest Regressor generally outperforms the Linear Regression model in this project, as indicated by its higher R2 score and lower MSE. The final chosen model, in this case, Random Forest, is saved for future use, indicating that it has been deemed the more accurate and robust model for predicting California housing prices.
